Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Karl Entwistle. I am a software engineer with a passion for technology and learning. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Goldsmiths, University of London, and have worked in the software industry for over 10 years.

I have experience in a wide range of technologies, but I am particularly interested in web development with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). I am driven by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and enjoy exploring new advancements in the field.
